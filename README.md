# BookSearchEngine

[![MIT Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://mit-license.org/)

## Description

For this assignment we were provided a fully functional Book Search application which used RESTful API pathways and refactor it to use GraphQL APIs with an Apollo Server. Changes were made to the back-end to use graphql queries, with the relevant queries and mutations. Then I applied those changes by utilizing useMutation, useQuery, and useEffect React hooks in order to fully refactor the API pathways.

## Dependencies

Most notably:

- apollo-server-express
- @apollo/client
- graphql
- mongoose
- jsonwebtoken
- react

## Demonstration

You can view my deployed site through my [Heroku App](https://ell-book-search-engine.herokuapp.com/).
